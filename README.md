# Simple network canary examples

A network canary is a software that detects signs of a network breach. In the same way as canary birds used in the coal mines during the nineteenth century would allow the miners to flee dangerous gas, the goal of this canary software is to detect ongoing intrusions to limit their impact and attempt to protect critical data while it is still time.
